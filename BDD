User of my application can:
    * Create passwords locker account with their details, a login username and password.
    * Store already existing account credentials in the application. Assuming I already have a twitter account, I want to store my already existing twitter username and password in the application.
    * Create new account credentials in the application. For example, if they have not yet signed up for Instagram, they would want to create a credentials account for Instagram in the application and the application generates a password for me to use when they sign up for Instagram.
    * Have the option of putting in a password that they want to use for the new credential account. For example, when creating an Instagram credential account, they have an option of putting in the password I want to use instead of having the application generate a password for me.
    * View various account credentials and their passwords in the application.
    * Delete a credentials account that they no longer need in the application
